## What It Does

Most movie apps recommend based on genre or ratings. **MoodieMovie recommends based on how you feel right now.**

You pick a mood — cozy, thrilling, mind-bending, feel-good — and Claude AI analyzes your emotional state to surface films that genuinely fit that moment, with a personalised explanation for *why* each pick works for you.

---

## Key Features

- **Mood-Based AI Recommendations** — Claude interprets 8 mood categories and returns curated picks with reasoning, not just a list
- **Moodie AI Chat** — Conversational assistant that refines recommendations through natural dialogue
- **Real-Time Movie Data** — Live trending, now playing, and coming soon via TMDb API
- **Watchlist & Friends Activity** — Save films, track what friends are watching
- **Voice Search** — Search by speaking, not typing
- **PWA Ready** — Installable on mobile home screen for native app feel

## How It Works

```
User selects mood
       ↓
Mood + context sent to Claude API (claude-sonnet model)
       ↓
Claude returns: film recommendations + personalised reason per film
       ↓
Film IDs passed to TMDb API → fetch posters, ratings, trailers
       ↓
Results rendered with full metadata to user
```

Claude doesn't just pick movies — it explains *why* a specific film fits your current emotional state. That explanation is generated fresh for every mood selection, making each session feel personal.

## What I Learned Building This

- **Prompt engineering for structured output** — Getting Claude to return consistent JSON (film title, reason, tone) required careful output scaffolding with explicit format instructions
- **Chaining two APIs** — Claude generates film suggestions; TMDb fetches the actual metadata. Coordinating async calls and handling mismatches between Claude's suggestions and TMDb's database was the core engineering challenge
- **Mood-to-prompt translation** — Mapping vague human emotions ("I feel cozy") into precise Claude prompts that produce relevant, non-generic recommendations took significant iteration
- **PWA architecture** — Service workers, manifest files, and offline caching for mobile installation
